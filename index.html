            <h2>About Me</h2>  
            <p>I am an aspiring Full-stack web development with an education background in <strong>Management Information Systems</strong>. My education has
            equipped me with strong skills in database management, data analytics, programming, and systems analysis, along with a
            keen understanding of business processes and project management. To enhance my analytical skills and technical expertise,
            I have pursued comprehensive training through the Full-Stack Data Analytics program at RevoU where I have developed
            proficiency in Python, SQL, and Tableau. In my recent project at RevoU, using Exploratory Data Analysis, I analyzed sales
            growth data for coffee sales, identified key trends, and developed several improvement plans that could potentially lead to a
            120% increase in sales. My background in Management Information Systems together with my technical expertise as a data
            analyst shaped me as a detail-oriented and impact-focused professional. I find great satisfaction in delving into data,
            uncovering hidden insights, and leveraging those insights to drive business growth. I am eager to bring my skills and passion
            for data analysis to a dynamic team where I can contribute to achieving strategic goals and making data-driven decisions.
            right now i want to switch my career into focusing more on IT side such as web/app development.
